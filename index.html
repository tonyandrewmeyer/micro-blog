			 <p>&ldquo;In matters of romance, destiny&rsquo;s role was overstated. Most of the magic was in how any two vaguely suited people could discover the wonder of each other if given space and time. &hellip; Accepting that truth both took away some of the enchantment in love, the romance book type of magic, and added a different kind of wonder in its place, one that perhaps made you a better person.&rdquo; &ndash; The Book That Held Her Heart (Mark Lawrence)</p>

			 <p>Interesting <a href="https://awful.systems/post/5038263">predictions about the next AI winter</a>.</p>
<p>I think the neutral value point is overstated - lots of people (outside tech) are pretty positive still, and the bubble popping will only partly counter that. I do think there will be a small move towards bad.</p>
<p>Tech crash: 100%</p>
<p>Scrapers: yes, seems very likely. I suspect a rise in ways to purchase data from high quality, human generated, content stores.</p>
<p>Mockery: like the first one, I&rsquo;m less sure. Yeah, there&rsquo;s plenty of this, but there&rsquo;s also a lot of amazement, and I think it will wash out a bit.</p>

<p>The other story is much more typical, and it goes something like this: I&rsquo;d love to leave, but there&rsquo;s something keeping me.

<ul>
<li>Computers are good at detecting computer-automated stuff, and should be used for this as much as possible.</li>
<li>Computers are not great at detecting novel human-driven stuff, and they never will be. Particularly abuse of authorized tools and access.</li>
<li>Adversary goals to intrude into networks will never change.</li>
<li>Adversaries will always invest in both AI tools and large human work forces.</li>
<li>Keeping both these rules in mind, we will always need human defenders to keep up with novel human techniques, and to improve our automation-detecting and task-automating tools.</li>

			 <p>&ldquo;Many rank-and-file engineers have stories about submitting their resignation, or threatening to quit, and their managers plying them with stock or cash or promotions to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this happen to me three times. One worked out really well, and we were both happy for years after. One worked out ok, but didn&rsquo;t last as long. One left both sides less happy (but with me earning much more and the company keeping me for a while longer).</p>

But the numbers are: 113-&gt;119-&gt;165 for Europe, and 77-&gt;34-&gt;28 for Asia, with a 22 person increase overall.

The best strategy is almost always to avoid conflict.
Quitting the news enhances happiness.
Mental health is a very real thing, and you never completely heal from abuse.
Becoming a parent changes everything.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m no expert on TV viewing metrics, but this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figures provided by TVNZ show the premiere episode of NZ’s Best Homes with Phil Spencer had an average audience of 490,000 – almost half a million people. Notably, that was more than the 473,900 who tuned into the final episode of Sunday last month&rdquo; (<a href="https://thespinoff.co.nz/pop-culture/11-06-2024/nzs-best-homes-is-the-opposite-of-sunday-maybe-thats-why-its-working">This Spinoff</a>)</p>
<p>sounds to me like the people who are watching linear TV on a Sunday night don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s on, they&rsquo;re just watching at that time.</p>
<p>It also boggles my mind that about a tenth of NZ are still watching linear TV.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://zerodha.tech/blog/remoteness-of-remote-work/">&ldquo;The hard lesson we learnt is that effective, long term remote work requires specific skill sets and DNA to pull off.&quot;</a></p>
<p>I wish people took that as the lesson rather than &ldquo;remote work doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;. I also feel like orgs that suddenly became remote/distributed did it poorly in most cases so have come to poor conclusions.</p>
<p>Interesting comments on language, too. Canonical seems to do this well, even with ~100 countries. I&rsquo;m not sure why that is.</p>
<p>Somewhat a side note, but I agree this with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While many orgs have the utopian goal of committing the entirety of institutional memory into neat documentation, knowledge maps, and wikis, I have come to realise that it is essentially a pipe dream. If we look around, rarely is an org able to copy another org’s culture or way of working</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The list of good traits to look for when hiring for remote/distributed is good, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;you’re not going to hire infinite PMs, have them sit on 1:1 customer calls [- you’re] instead going to look for friction - you’re going to find customer pain points, passive negative feedback - and you’re going to optimize the product around that&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;developers who go from BigCo to SmallCo often bring Sentry with them. BigCo might have chosen to self-host Sentry, but SmallCo could care less, and simply opts for our cloud service.

			 <p><a href="https://www.willett.io/posts/4999/">Suggestions on how to build software</a>. ✅= matches my experience, ❌ = not wrong, but not my experience:</p>
<p>✅ Developers are most effective when they’re familiar with many systems, not just one or two.
❌ Automation (e.g. continuous deployment) can cause as many problems at it solves.
✅ Keep the dev cycle near-instantaneous.
✅ Take advantage of the recency bias.
✅ Prefer projects with small organizational scopes.
✅ Check in often, with everybody, about a project’s perceived value.
✅ Don’t measure proxies.
✅ Allowing developer autonomy will make or break a project.
❓ Metrics are for software, not people.
✅ Everybody wins when people can just manage themselves.
✅ Intrinsics play only a small role in human potential.

			 <p>Of these <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/amirs-10-laws-of-tech-64536bf8eeff">10 laws of tech</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;A technology that was built for good will eventually be also used for bad&rdquo; - I&rsquo;m sure I agree with this. It seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of tech that just isn&rsquo;t useful enough to be bad with.</li>
<li>&ldquo;A company’s technology stack will be based on the experience and preferences of the first technical person in that company&rdquo; - for the most part, but more based on those of the most senior people, which is to be expected, and the first person tends to be the most senior for some time.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The most painful, and least useful projects are migration projects, yet companies will replace technologies every 4 years&rdquo; - 100%</li>
<li>&ldquo;Every major technology is going to be followed by a movement to eradicate that technology because it’s going to ruin us&rdquo; - huh?</li>
<li>&ldquo;A highly communicative and collaborative team of average engineers, is going to outperform an uncommunicative and non-collaborative team of great engineers&rdquo; - most of the time, yes.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Left alone, a product team will optimize to the closest and easiest goal&rdquo; - mostly, yes.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Some aspects of tech are pseudo theological&rdquo; - yes, which is why these decisions need to get automated away; the choice doesn&rsquo;t matter, taking away the discussion does.</li>
<li>&ldquo;When you hire someone from another company, you take some of that company’s DNA into your own company&rdquo; - yes, see also acquisitions.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Everyone celebrates version 1.0.0 — but it is version 1.0.3 that actually brings customer value&rdquo; - yes, although a lot of things don&rsquo;t have an explicit version number like that any more, of course.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Someone in 10 years is going to call your shiny new software “old crap” and will wonder who the hell designed such a bad product&rdquo; - 100%, sigh.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The best informal culture is almost always bottoms up. But managers, execs, HR/People teams, etc can encourage informal culture. One of the most powerful things you can do is just participate. Show up for drinks, play the board games, keep the puns rolling, get silly with your team! Your participation gives people permission and shows that you value their creative cultural labor at work.</p>

			 <p>Very much agree with this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most effective developers I&rsquo;ve worked with understand this, and are adept navigating this zone. They are curious about the perspectives and needs of other stakeholders, and ask good questions. They push back when things don&rsquo;t make sense, but do so tactfully. And they understand the realities of building software in an industry context, where there are budgets, deadlines, and other less-than fun realities. They don&rsquo;t expect everything is perfectly spelled out for them (whether by designer, business analyst, or architect), because they know, as the one closest to the implementation, they have a crucial perspective to voice. But they also know they don&rsquo;t have all the answers. In other words, they know that building the right software is a back-and-forth, collaborative process.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>💯 this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the argument always goes: Sure, but you have to manage these machines! The cloud is so much simpler! The savings will all be there in labor costs! Except no. Anyone who thinks running a major service like HEY or Basecamp in the cloud is &ldquo;simple&rdquo; has clearly never tried. Some things are simpler, others more complex, but on the whole, I&rsquo;ve yet to hear of organizations at our scale being able to materially shrink their operations team, just because they moved to the cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although it always seems an oversimplification to pick one or the other - in most orgs there will be a mix of systems, some that suit the small or unpredictable wins of public cloud and some that suit going the other way.</p>

			 <p>I think this is probably true in most cases:</p>
<p>Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools. Their manager might, but engineering managers only want to pay for discrete new capabilities</p>
<p>It feels like this is where the big players like Atlassian and Microsoft have such a huge advantage because if you can bundle your tool into something the org already pays for it is such an easy win.</p>
<p>I would be reluctant to get into the &ldquo;build a dev tool&rdquo; market unless I was just looking to get acquired or wasn&rsquo;t looking to make money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced at all about the whole AI coding thing (sending data plus the ethical bit plus the actual value outside of demos).</p>
<p>I pay for tools, but I feel like I&rsquo;m an exception.</p>

			 <p>Not sure how much of this <a href="https://blog.alexewerlof.com/p/tech-debt-day">post on tech debt handling</a> I agree with. These seem naive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first rule is not to create tech debt in the first place.</li>
<li>The PR (Pull Request) that creates tech debt should come paired with the issue to deal with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a nice idea but challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended (but optional) to demo the results in the next team demo.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general this seems less flexible than just saying &ldquo;20% of the quarter is allocated for tech-debt&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve tried a bunch of solutions along these lines over the years. I&rsquo;m not sure which of them have been most successful.</p>

			 <p>This <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/02/16/monitoring-debt-builds-up-faster-than-software-teams-can-pay-it-off/">SO post on monitoring debt</a> seems to miss over half of what monitoring debt actually is. Too many things being monitored. Bad noise levels in alerts. Knowing when the monitoring itself is failing. Updating monitoring systems both for just general bug fixes and for new functionality. Old monitoring that is no longer required. Etc.</p>
