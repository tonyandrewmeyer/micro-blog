			 <p>I had a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/19/recovering-lost-code/">recover lost code experience</a> similar to this a couple of weeks ago. In my case the VM crashed and when it rebooted the mount was missing, which made it look like the folder I had been working was empty. Claude recovered almost everything from logs (great, but a bit scary) before I realised everything was still there on the host.</p>

<p>Maybe the answer is that we need better tools — better ways to signal quality, better ways to share context, better ways to make the AI’s involvement visible and reviewable. Maybe the culture will self-correct as people hit walls. Maybe this is just the awkward transition phase before we figure out new norms.</p>

<p>I feel like this is true - and that probably a lot of these tools are already being built, and culture will eventually catch up. But maybe it&rsquo;s an optimistic take.</p>

<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/">Optimism, on the other hand, is a toxin to be avoided. Optimism is a subgenre of fatalism, the belief that things will get better no matter what we do. It&rsquo;s just the obverse of pessimism. Both are ways of denying human agency. To be an optimist is to be a passenger of history, along for the ride, with no hope of changing its course.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I very much disagree with this definition of optimism. Optimism is a belief that things will get better <em>because</em> most people will actually work for that. Basically, it&rsquo;s faith (not necessarily in a higher power), which is oddly missing from the happiness, optimism, hope trilogy here.</p>
<p>In fact, I think he entirely swaps the definition of hope and optimism. I am not at all optimistic (in that I don&rsquo;t believe people will rise up, or that the people with power will make things truly better) but I have hope (unfounded, not driven by people action) that I am wrong.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen this mentioned in other similar attempts, and I agree it&rsquo;s an interesting change in dynamics. It&rsquo;s interesting also in terms of hiring and how broad language experience should be (or not) within a team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once, having people port your code to other languages was something to take pride in. It was a sign of accomplishment — a project was “cool enough” that someone put time into making it available elsewhere. With agents, it doesn’t invoke the same feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m still curious to see how this plays out. I have seen several people unhappy about this - for now, ones like Armin vibespiling his own work seems the safest path.</p>

<p>The fact is, our lifetimes have been an extreme anomaly.

			 <p>An <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#atom-everything">excellent summary of AI in 2025</a> from Simon Willison.</p>
<p>One point that I&rsquo;m unsure about is the potential end of MCP: I agree that for coding purposes it doesn&rsquo;t make sense (if you have a service without a CLI tool, build a great CLI tool, not an MCP server, for it). However, I still wonder if there is use for non-coding purposes (I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with this for opal3). I don&rsquo;t trust AI running my browser (as Simon explains), so how else do I interact (as a non-coder) with a closed system? Maybe there should just be a <code>.wellknown</code> link with a skill, but I still need to help the agent authenticate somehow. But will people use &ldquo;custom connectors&rdquo; in Claude, and similar features in other agents?</p>

<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PM, engineers and exec team then meet to discuss questions like:
Are our 10 biggest customers happy users of the product?
Do high ICP and non-ICP customers use the product differently?
Why was churn high last month? Can we identify any reasons?
Can we find leading indicators that predict long-term product usage? (e.g. Facebook’s 7 friends in 10 days)
Where in the onboarding funnel do new users struggle?</p>

<p>Does this library represent a legal violation of copyright of either the Rust library or the Python one?
Even if this is legal, is it ethical to build a library in this way?
Does this format of development hurt the open source ecosystem?
Is it responsible to publish software libraries built in this way?
How much better would this library be if an expert team hand crafted it over the course of several months?</p>

<p>Obviously, a lawyer (or court) needs to answer the first one (and potentially it differs by country). I don&rsquo;t know what my answers to the other four are.</p>

			 <p>Interesting <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/12/26/reflecting-on-life">reflections on life last year</a> from Armin Ronacher.</p>
<p>I love &ldquo;dare to commit&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life isn’t about sampling everything; it’s about making deliberate choices and committing to the ones that matter. You don’t need to date twenty people to find the right partner, nor do you need a network of hundred acquaintances to succeed. Similarly, you don’t need to work at ten different companies to build a meaningful career.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on children:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You grow above yourself when all the sudden become fully responsible for another human being and you can’t opt out of it. It also invites you to reflect on yourself more and how you came to be the person that you are. I also don’t think it makes you any less ambitious, but it changes how you define success for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And his final note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever your journey may look like, I hope you find joy, purpose, and the courage to commit fully to it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding this final aside:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>II think the user experience around commenting on documents is fundamentally wrong in most document editors. &hellip; Ultimately, you want to collect all your comments into a bundle, then review that bundle for consistency and duplicates, and then submit that bundle as commentary, but editors don’t support that flow particularly well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made this argument (and others!) against using Google Docs for this type of document and review before and have consistently lost the argument. What does have this flow? GitHub pull requests.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The subscription technology isn&rsquo;t the issue here. The defining characteristic of email is that it&rsquo;s open: anyone can add to your inbox if they have your address. With RSS, I have to explicitly allow new entries into my reader (a feed at a time). You can do that with email too: just add the sender to an allow list, and have that only work if the sender is verified (DMARC). Unfortunately, email client development stagnated and we don&rsquo;t have good tooling for this.</p>
<p>RSS reader somewhat stagnated too, but seems to attract more indy love than email client development. Or more successful development, anyway.</p>

No, because even a single 60 second stoplight will eat up your entire time budget. F1 cars slow down to mini-van speeds in basic turns.

<p>I think the neutral value point is overstated - lots of people (outside tech) are pretty positive still, and the bubble popping will only partly counter that. I do think there will be a small move towards bad.</p>
<p>Tech crash: 100%</p>
<p>Scrapers: yes, seems very likely. I suspect a rise in ways to purchase data from high quality, human generated, content stores.</p>

<p>The other story is much more typical, and it goes something like this: I&rsquo;d love to leave, but there&rsquo;s something keeping me. One more year and I&rsquo;ll get a new title, and then I&rsquo;ll be so well-placed for a new job. I&rsquo;ve heard the market is bad, so I should wait until it picks up again. I&rsquo;ll get a raise soon, then I&rsquo;ll negotiate for a new job. I&rsquo;m scared of keeping up with mortgage repayments.

			 <p>Five basic rules from <a href="https://tisiphone.net/2025/02/26/why-ai-cant-replace-cybersecurity-analysts/">Lesley Carhart</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers are good at detecting computer-automated stuff, and should be used for this as much as possible.</li>
<li>Computers are not great at detecting novel human-driven stuff, and they never will be. Particularly abuse of authorized tools and access.</li>
<li>Adversary goals to intrude into networks will never change.</li>
<li>Adversaries will always invest in both AI tools and large human work forces.</li>
<li>Keeping both these rules in mind, we will always need human defenders to keep up with novel human techniques, and to improve our automation-detecting and task-automating tools.</li>

			 <p>In a <a href="https://mattgemmell.scot/20-years/">reflection of the last 20 years</a> Matt Gemmell has 5 lessons learnt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no substitute for just doing the work, day after day, year after year.
The best strategy is almost always to avoid conflict.
Quitting the news enhances happiness.
Mental health is a very real thing, and you never completely heal from abuse.
Becoming a parent changes everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These all resonate with me very strongly.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m no expert on TV viewing metrics, but this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figures provided by TVNZ show the premiere episode of NZ’s Best Homes with Phil Spencer had an average audience of 490,000 – almost half a million people. Notably, that was more than the 473,900 who tuned into the final episode of Sunday last month&rdquo; (<a href="https://thespinoff.co.nz/pop-culture/11-06-2024/nzs-best-homes-is-the-opposite-of-sunday-maybe-thats-why-its-working">This Spinoff</a>)</p>
<p>sounds to me like the people who are watching linear TV on a Sunday night don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s on, they&rsquo;re just watching at that time.</p>
<p>It also boggles my mind that about a tenth of NZ are still watching linear TV.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://zerodha.tech/blog/remoteness-of-remote-work/">&ldquo;The hard lesson we learnt is that effective, long term remote work requires specific skill sets and DNA to pull off.&quot;</a></p>
<p>I wish people took that as the lesson rather than &ldquo;remote work doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;. I also feel like orgs that suddenly became remote/distributed did it poorly in most cases so have come to poor conclusions.</p>
<p>Interesting comments on language, too. Canonical seems to do this well, even with ~100 countries. I&rsquo;m not sure why that is.</p>
<p>Somewhat a side note, but I agree this with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While many orgs have the utopian goal of committing the entirety of institutional memory into neat documentation, knowledge maps, and wikis, I have come to realise that it is essentially a pipe dream. If we look around, rarely is an org able to copy another org’s culture or way of working</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The list of good traits to look for when hiring for remote/distributed is good, too.</p>

But they’re also quite happy to binge 10-hour factual series on Netflix, or listen to 90-minute podcasts.&quot;</a> - So true, and hardly ever acknowledged!</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;The next problem is the idea that you can get a lot of things ‘at once’ and test them against each other, thus reaching some definitive conclusion. In doing this, you root out the bad, but you don’t/can’t hone in on the good. Why? Becuase the difference between fine, good, and best is in the nuance. You only experience nuance with extended use.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.willett.io/posts/4999/">Suggestions on how to build software</a>. ✅= matches my experience, ❌ = not wrong, but not my experience:</p>
<p>✅ Developers are most effective when they’re familiar with many systems, not just one or two.
❌ Automation (e.g. continuous deployment) can cause as many problems at it solves.
✅ Keep the dev cycle near-instantaneous.
✅ Take advantage of the recency bias.
✅ Prefer projects with small organizational scopes.
✅ Check in often, with everybody, about a project’s perceived value.
✅ Don’t measure proxies.
✅ Allowing developer autonomy will make or break a project.
❓ Metrics are for software, not people.
✅ Everybody wins when people can just manage themselves.
✅ Intrinsics play only a small role in human potential.

			 <p>Of these <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/amirs-10-laws-of-tech-64536bf8eeff">10 laws of tech</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;A technology that was built for good will eventually be also used for bad&rdquo; - I&rsquo;m sure I agree with this. It seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of tech that just isn&rsquo;t useful enough to be bad with.</li>
<li>&ldquo;A company’s technology stack will be based on the experience and preferences of the first technical person in that company&rdquo; - for the most part, but more based on those of the most senior people, which is to be expected, and the first person tends to be the most senior for some time.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The most painful, and least useful projects are migration projects, yet companies will replace technologies every 4 years&rdquo; - 100%</li>
<li>&ldquo;Every major technology is going to be followed by a movement to eradicate that technology because it’s going to ruin us&rdquo; - huh?</li>
<li>&ldquo;A highly communicative and collaborative team of average engineers, is going to outperform an uncommunicative and non-collaborative team of great engineers&rdquo; - most of the time, yes.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Left alone, a product team will optimize to the closest and easiest goal&rdquo; - mostly, yes.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Some aspects of tech are pseudo theological&rdquo; - yes, which is why these decisions need to get automated away; the choice doesn&rsquo;t matter, taking away the discussion does.</li>
<li>&ldquo;When you hire someone from another company, you take some of that company’s DNA into your own company&rdquo; - yes, see also acquisitions.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Everyone celebrates version 1.0.0 — but it is version 1.0.3 that actually brings customer value&rdquo; - yes, although a lot of things don&rsquo;t have an explicit version number like that any more, of course.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Someone in 10 years is going to call your shiny new software “old crap” and will wonder who the hell designed such a bad product&rdquo; - 100%, sigh.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The best informal culture is almost always bottoms up. But managers, execs, HR/People teams, etc can encourage informal culture. One of the most powerful things you can do is just participate. Show up for drinks, play the board games, keep the puns rolling, get silly with your team! Your participation gives people permission and shows that you value their creative cultural labor at work.</p>

			 <p>Very much agree with this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most effective developers I&rsquo;ve worked with understand this, and are adept navigating this zone. They are curious about the perspectives and needs of other stakeholders, and ask good questions. They push back when things don&rsquo;t make sense, but do so tactfully. And they understand the realities of building software in an industry context, where there are budgets, deadlines, and other less-than fun realities. They don&rsquo;t expect everything is perfectly spelled out for them (whether by designer, business analyst, or architect), because they know, as the one closest to the implementation, they have a crucial perspective to voice. But they also know they don&rsquo;t have all the answers. In other words, they know that building the right software is a back-and-forth, collaborative process.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the argument always goes: Sure, but you have to manage these machines! The cloud is so much simpler! The savings will all be there in labor costs! Except no. Anyone who thinks running a major service like HEY or Basecamp in the cloud is &ldquo;simple&rdquo; has clearly never tried. Some things are simpler, others more complex, but on the whole, I&rsquo;ve yet to hear of organizations at our scale being able to materially shrink their operations team, just because they moved to the cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although it always seems an oversimplification to pick one or the other - in most orgs there will be a mix of systems, some that suit the small or unpredictable wins of public cloud and some that suit going the other way.</p>

			 <p>I think this is probably true in most cases:</p>
<p>Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools. Their manager might, but engineering managers only want to pay for discrete new capabilities</p>
<p>It feels like this is where the big players like Atlassian and Microsoft have such a huge advantage because if you can bundle your tool into something the org already pays for it is such an easy win.</p>
<p>I would be reluctant to get into the &ldquo;build a dev tool&rdquo; market unless I was just looking to get acquired or wasn&rsquo;t looking to make money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced at all about the whole AI coding thing (sending data plus the ethical bit plus the actual value outside of demos).</p>
<p>I pay for tools, but I feel like I&rsquo;m an exception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice that they open-sourced most of their code when they ended. <a href="https://www.kite.com/blog/product/kite-is-saying-farewell/">www.kite.com/blog/prod&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>Not sure how much of this <a href="https://blog.alexewerlof.com/p/tech-debt-day">post on tech debt handling</a> I agree with. These seem naive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first rule is not to create tech debt in the first place.</li>
<li>The PR (Pull Request) that creates tech debt should come paired with the issue to deal with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a nice idea but challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended (but optional) to demo the results in the next team demo.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general this seems less flexible than just saying &ldquo;20% of the quarter is allocated for tech-debt&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve tried a bunch of solutions along these lines over the years. I&rsquo;m not sure which of them have been most successful.</p>

Too many things being monitored. Bad noise levels in alerts. Knowing when the monitoring itself is failing. Updating monitoring systems both for just general bug fixes and for new functionality. Old monitoring that is no longer required. Etc.</p>
